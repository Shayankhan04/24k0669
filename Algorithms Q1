#Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6).
#If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.
Ask the user to enter N(number that is divisor) 
Ask the user to enter n(number that is divided by the divisor)
Set division to n/N
IF division is INTEGER THEN
  IF division MOD 2 is 0 THEN
    Number is EVEN
  ELSE Number is ODD
